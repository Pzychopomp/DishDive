### Expectations

At this stage, we expect to have completed the initial planning phase, including defining project goals, user stories, and wireframes. We anticipate having a clear understanding of the app's architecture and design direction. Additionally, we aim to have begun development, with each team member assigned to their respective tasks.

### Workflow

Our workflow involves regular meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and adjustments to the project plan. We are utilizing tools such as Figma for UI/UX design, Xcode with SwiftUI for frontend development, MongoDB for backend integration and database management, and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
