## Project Details

### Main Idea

Our main idea is to create an iOS app called "DishDive" where users can store, discover, and share recipes with a community-driven approach. The app will focus on promoting culinary exploration and community engagement through recipe sharing and collaboration.

### Expectations

At this stage(5/10/2024), our team has everything we wanted to do within this timeframe implemented. We have made it so items can populate the feed with a preview of the picture and the name. We have also created a profile page along with pages for registration and login.

### Workflow

Our workflow involves regular meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and adjustments to the project plan. We are utilizing tools such as Figma for UI/UX design, Xcode with SwiftUI for frontend development, MongoDB for backend integration and database management, and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
